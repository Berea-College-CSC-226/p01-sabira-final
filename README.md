indicates action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no in it!)

**References**: 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design (due 1 Dec 2021)

‚ùóÔ∏è**Title**: What is the title of your project?

Let's shop together!

**Purpose**: In a single sentence, describe what your project will do.

My program is going to display various items from the shop and once you click on each,
the program will generate a barcode for it and draw the barcode for a successful shopping. 

**Sources**: Which assignments or code will you base your project on?

A08 - UPC Bar code

‚ùóÔ∏è**CRC Card**:
  - Please write a CRC card for a class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo (due 10 Dec 2021)

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. Use this section to create a bullet list of all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged here will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
